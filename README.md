# Raspberry Pi Autonomous Car Project

The goal of this project is to create a fleet of Raspberry Pi cars which are able to navigate around an indoor environment using cameras,
ultrasonic sensors and indoor Bluetooth beacons.

As the project progresses, the readme will be updated with the relevant documentation.
