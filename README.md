# Raspberry Pi Autonomous Car Project

The goal of this project is to create a fleet of Raspberry Pi cars which are able to navigate around an indoor environment using cameras and ultrasonic sensors. 

The cars run Python, with OpenCV, Tensorflow and Scikit-learn as dependencies. See the Report for more details.
